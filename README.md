## Introduction

Data and reproducible code for our *JAMA Pediatrics* research letter,
“[Modeling the health impact of discontinuing COVID-19 vaccination
during pregnancy in the
US](http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.3561)”, which uses
publicly-available data to simulate the impact of removing the COVID-19
vaccine from the recommended list of vaccinations for pregnant people.

## Structure

This project is structured as follows:

- **`code`**: Contains all code used for this project. Designed to be
  run sequentially.

  and plots.
- **`data_raw`**: Contains publicly available raw data necessary to run
  the simulation.
- **`output`**: Contains numerical representations (in `csv` format) of
  all primary figures.
- **`plots`**: Contains figures used the manuscript in `jpg` and `pdf`
  formats.
- **`rmds`**: Contains code to generate numbers used in the manuscript.
